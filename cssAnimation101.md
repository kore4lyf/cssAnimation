## Chapter 2 - Why animate?
- “Animation is about creating the illusion of life.” Brad Bird

### More than words alone
- Animation can convey information efficiently and grab attention (Communication).
- Movement in our designs gives us a more powerful way to communicate.
- ubtle and appropriate animation can add appeal to our designs and credibility to our work.
- We’re very good at spotting movement. This is something we have evolved to do. Adding a little animation here and there can introduce some of that “illusion of life” in a very subtle way.

### What is animation on the web?
- We can use animation to tell a story. However,
telling stories through our content doesn’t always need to be so literal. We can add subtle movement, such as showing data changes in a chart. In this way, data can itself tell a story with animation helping.

### With great power comes great responsibility
- It can be easy to do too much with animation. Having too many things moving around on the page at once is distracting.
- Try to do less animation when possible.
- This might mean only moving a small item on your page.
- If you want to create more of a “wow” effect with larger animations, you can do so. Just stop when your viewers need to focus on the content. This might mean setting animations to play once rather than infinitely, or stopping animations when people begin to scroll a page.


### Inspiration
- Animation has a long and rich history. I recently wrote a post on Principles of Animation for the Web. The principles draw from Disney’s 1981 book The Illusion of Life: Disney Animation.
- For loads of great examples, take some time to browse Hover States. This site features all sorts of interesting examples of animation from the web. Dribbble.com is helpful also.

### Summary
- Animation is kind of a big deal
- Used right, it can be a useful and powerful tool in our designs
- Use it to grab attention or convey information
- Don’t overdo it
- If you want to stand out, animation can really help

### Homework
Think about your own work and how animation might help.
Try not to go crazy and animate all the things. Look for ways subtle animation might better help your visitors understand the content. Is there a call-to-action on your page people are missing? Is there a sudden change in your page that’s happening too suddenly, and could benefit from a smoother transition?
Lastly, take a look at sites like **Hover States** and **Little Big Details** and **Dribbble**. These sorts of sites help if you’re ever stuck for ideas.

## Chapter 4 - Transitions
### Transitions
- One way CSS lets us control animation in the browser with the transition property. In browser terms, a transition is an animation from one state to another.
- When we use a transition on an element we tell the browser that we want it to interpolate, or automatically calculate, the change between states.

### Transition properties
### In summary
- A transition is the change from one state to another. For example, when hovering
over an element, its style might change. Transitions allow the change to become
a smooth animation.
### Homework 



## Chapter 5 - Animations
### Animation in the browser 
- While transitions are all about smoothing the change from state A to state B, animations are a way to describe multiple steps.
- Animations are useful for more complex movement in the browser. In the above example, there are 3 states (A, B and C). A transition would only go from A to C while an animation allows us to specify what step B looks like and make sure the animation follows all three steps.
- Animations also behave a little differently. They can begin automatically. While
a transition might require adding a class or a change of state such as hovering,
animations can start when the page loads



### Examples
### Transitions vs Animations
- Transitions are when the browser animates from one state to another (A to B).
They’re usually triggered by an action such hovering over an element, or adding
or removing a class using JavaScript.
Animations are more involved, and let you create sequences of animations with
as many key
